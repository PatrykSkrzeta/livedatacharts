# LIVE DATA CHARTS IN REAL TIME
## INTRO
A script that allows us to analyze live data from charts. I used an example of auto-generated data (vehicles driven past the road per hour), but in my opinion, the script shows its potential itself. It can be used for data that is too hard to read or to track, for example, stocks like BTC-USD.
## INSTALLATION
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
